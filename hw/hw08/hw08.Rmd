### Instructions 
* Solutions will be released on Friday, November 3rd. 
* This semester, problem sets are for practice only and will not be turned in for marks.

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will save you and the GSIs from frustration!

- To avoid code running off the page, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the file. If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

## Section 1: High school e-cigarette usage

You would like to conduct a survey of high school students to determine
the proportion who are current e-cigarettes users. Before you conduct your 
survey, you need to determine how large of a sample size to use. Suppose that you would like the width of the 95% confidence interval to be 2.5 percentage points.

**1. Determine the most conservative sample size required to create a confidence interval of width 2.5 percentage points and assign it to the object `p1`. Recall that to do this, you need to use a $p^*$ of 0.5.**

```{r}
p1 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p1

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p1.R")
```

**2. You've seen a [recent publication](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2698112/prevalence-distribution-e-cigarette-use-among-u-s-adults-behavioral) from the Annals of Internal Medicine that estimated 9.2% of individuals aged 18 to 24 years old are current e-cigarette users. What is the sample size estimate assuming that $p^*=0.092$?**

```{r}
p2 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p2


# YOUR CODE HERE

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p2.R")
```

\newpage

**3. The recent publication referenced in the previous question only looked at adults (aged 18+), but observed that the rate of current e-cigarette use was inversely related to age among the population they surveyed. Because of this finding would you suppose that the sample size estimated in question 2 is too low or too high? Assign your letter choice ("a" or "b") to `p3`.**

a) too low
b) too high

p3 <- NULL # YOUR ANSWER CHOICE HERE
p3

## Section 2: Breastfeeding 
Exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life is recommended for optimal infant growth and development. Suppose that you conducted a survey of randomly chosen women from California and found that 775 out of 5615 new mothers exclusively breastfed their infants.

Use all four of the methods discussed in lecture and lab to create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of California infants who are exclusively breastfed. 

Use the concatenate function, `c()` to store your lower and upper bounds.

**4. Use the large sample method of constructing a 95% CI. Do not round the lower or upper bounds.**

```{r}
p4 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p4


# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p4.R")
```

**5. Use the Clopper Pearson (Exact) method for constructing a 95% CI. Do not round the lower or upper bounds.**

```{r}
p5 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p5


# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p5.R")
```

**6. Use the Wilson Score method of constructing a 95% CI with a continuity correction. Do not round the lower or upper bounds.** 

```{r}
p6 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p6


# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p6.R")
```

**7. Use the Plus Four method of constructing a 95% CI. Do not round the lower or upper bounds.**

```{r}
p7 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p7

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p7.R")
```

\newpage

**8. Create a table called `breastfeed_CIs` that contains each of the methods in the rows and their corresponding confidence interval lower and upper bounds in the columns. Then create a plot comparing the differences in confidence intervals by each method. If you are stuck, refer back to the example code presented in Lab 8.**

```{r}
p8 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p8

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p8.R")
```

\newpage 

**9. Do the methods produce confidence intervals that are basically the same or very different? Why?**

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

\newpage 

**10. Suppose that in 2010, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in California was known to be 18.6%. Based on the 95% CIs calculated in questions 4-7, is there evidence against the null hypothesis that the underlying rate is equal to 18.6% in favor of the alternative that the rate is different from 18.6%?**

## Section 3: HPV Vaccine 
The quadrivalent HPV vaccine was introduced to Canada in 2007, and was given to girls in Ontario, Canada who were enrolled in grade 8 (13-14 years old). Before 2007, no girls received the vaccine, while in the 4 years after it was introduced nearly 40% of girls received the vaccine each year. One concern that some people had was that the vaccine itself would increase promiscuity if the girls felt a false sense of protection, which could thereby increase the prevalence of other sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) among vaccinated girls. [This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25487660) examines this question using an advanced method called the "regression discontinuity" design which harnesses the abrupt change in vaccination status across cohorts of girls to estimate the causal effect of vaccination against HPV on the occurrence of other STIs.

Read only the abstract of the paper, and don't worry about the details because these are advanced methods. Note that the term "RD" is the difference in risk of STIs between girls exposed and unexposed to HPV vaccination. We can therefore think of this risk difference as the difference between two proportions.

**15. Interpret this result from the abstract: We identified 15/441 (5.9%) cases of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection and found no evidence that vaccination increased the risk of this composite outcome: RD per 1000 girls -0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI] -10.71 to 9.49). What does -0.61 estimate?**

**16. The 95% confidence interval includes 0. What can you conclude about the p-value for a two-sided test of the difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls and their risk of sexually transmitted diseases?**

## Section 4: Peanut Allergy 
An allergy to peanuts is increasingly common in Western countries. A randomized controlled trial enrolled infants with a diagnosed peanut
sensitivity. Infants were randomized to either avoid peanuts or to consume them regularly until they reached age 5. At the end of the study, 18 out of the 51 randomized to avoid peanuts were tested to be allergic to peanuts. Only 5 out of the 47 randomized to consuming them regularly were tested to be allergic to peanuts. 

**17. Estimate the difference between the two proportions.**

a) Both a 95% CI and a 99% CI will contain 0.
b) A 95% CI will contain 0, but a 99% CI will not.
c) A 95% CI will not contain 0, but a 99% CI will.
